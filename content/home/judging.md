## Submission Criteria

- Participants may submit as many questions as they like, but note that not all questions will pass our initial review. (See below for details). Submitting a large number of low-quality questions will not increase your chances of winning a prize.
- All questions should be submitted with exactly **four answer choices.**
-	Prizes will be awarded to the top two submissions for each of the following categories: Democrat “False Beliefs” and Republican “False Beliefs” (see prizes tab for award amounts)
- The deadline for submitting questions is October 15th, 2019 at 11:59 p.m.


## Judging Criteria

To determine winners for each category of question, we will do the following:

1. All questions will be subject to an initial review designed to screen out low-quality questions. (Given that we do not know how many questions we will receive, we cannot commit in advance to testing all submitted questions. It is our intention, however, to test all questions that could plausibly meet our criteria.)

2. We will collect all of the questions that pass our initial review and ask a large sample of real Republican and Democrat respondents to answer them. If two or more participants submit what is substantively the same question, then only the participant who submitted the question first will be considered for a prize.

3. To qualify as a high-quality “False Belief” question, participants from one major party should, on average, get the answer wrong more often than participants from the other major party. Additionally, both participants should have a hunch that their answer is right. Hunches will be gauged by asking participants to register the degree of confidence they have in their answers. What constitutes a reasonable “hunch” will be up to the judges’ discretion.

4. We will award prizes to the submissions that maximize the difference between the percentage of Republicans answering correctly and the percentage of Democrats answering correctly. (For the best questions we have developed so far, we have found that on average, the difference in the proportions of each party responding correctly exceeds 50%--for example, 76% of Republicans answer correctly, but only 24% of Democrats answer correctly.)  We will award at least two prizes in each category, and we will reward any submission beyond the top two that we consider to be “high-quality.”

For Republican "False Belief" questions (questions Republicans are likely to get wrong), we compute the following:

$$\mid \text{∣% Correct for Democrats - % Correct for Republicans} \mid $$

For Democratic "False Belief" questions, we compute the following:

$$\mid \text{% Correct for Republicans - % Correct for Democrats} \mid $$

Awards will be given for the questions that maximize the above quantities. We reserve the right to use our discretion to reward questions that are particularly unique or clever, over and above the strict quantitative criteria described above.

We will award $100 to any high-quality "False Belief" question.  In order to qualify as a "high-quality" question, the difference in the proportions of each party responding correctly should exceed **40%**. So, for example, a Republican could answer the submitted question correctly 82% of the time, whereas a Democrat could answer correctly 40% of the time, resulting in an accuracy spread of 42%.  

Moreover, the submitted question must satisfy the criteria described in the Overview section (e.g. they must be backed by credible sources; both parties should have a hunch that their answer is right; and the question should cover topics for which there is not precise, pre-existing beliefs about the answer to a question).  In the event that a large number of high-quality questions are submitted, we will reward prizes to only the Top 25 "False Belief" questions.
