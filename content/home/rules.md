We are accepting submissions on four types of trivia question.

1. **Democrat "Knowledge Deserts"** - These are **non-political** questions that a respondent who identifies as a Republican is much more likely to get right than a respondent who identifies as a Democrat.  Furthermore, the Republican should, on average, be much more confident in their answer than a Democrat.  Questions should be as apolitical as possible, and should tap into different knowledge pools, lifestyles, and consumption habits that a Republican might have.

Pilot testing has shown the following two questions are particularly good examples:

**What is the last name of the Duck Dynasty family?**
(a)	Davis
**(b) Robertson	**
(c) Wilson
(d) Johnson

The restaurant "Cracker Barrel" is known for having what game at each table?Â 
**(a) The Peg Game**
(b) Trivial Pursuit
(c) Connect 4
(d) Mancala

2. **Republican "Knowledge Deserts"** - These are **non-political** questions that a respondent who identifies as a **Democrat** is much more likely to get right than a respondent who identifies as a **Republican**.  The Democrat should, on average, also be much more confident in their answer than a Republican. Questions should be as apolitical as possible, asking questions that tap into different knowledge pools, lifestyles, and consumption habits. Pilot testing has shown the following questions are particularly good examples:


**What is Matcha?**
**(a) Tea**
(b) A comic series
(c) A TV show
(d) Coffee

**Which of the following is a song by Drake?**
**(a) Hotline Bling**
(b) HUMBLE
(c) Gold Digger
(d) Drop the World


3. **Republican "False Beliefs"** - These are explicitly political questions that a respondent who identifies as a **Democrat** is much more likely to get right than a respondent who identifies as a **Republican**.  Crucially, both Republican and Democrat respondents should be confident that their answer is correct, but there should be only one true, plainly defensible response.  Because these questions are politically contentious, they should be selected and phrased in a way to be as uncontroversial as possible (citing specific statistics, for example)

Here are two examples where the average Democrat is likely to guess closer to the correct answer than the average Republican:

**What percentage of climate change scientists believe that climate change is primarily caused by human activity?** (97%)

**Resumes with white-sounding names were how much more likely to get call-backs than the same resume with a black-sounding name?** (50%)

3. **Democrat "False Beliefs"** - These are explicitly political questions that a respondent who identifies as a **Republican** is much more likely to get right than a respondent who identifies as a **Democrat**.  Crucially, both Republican and Democrat respondents should be confident that their answer is correct, but there should be only one true, plainly defensible response.  Because these questions are politically contentious, they should be selected and phrased in a way to be as uncontroversial as possible (citing specific statistics, for example)

Here are two examples where the average Republican is likely to guess closer to the correct answer than the average Democrat:

**What is the safest form of energy, as determined by "mortality rate per kilowatt hour?"**
**(a) Nuclear power**
(b) Solar power
(c) Wind power
(d) Hydro power

**What percentage of gun deaths in 2016 were caused by assault-style rifles?**	(2%)
