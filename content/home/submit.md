To submit to this contest please click [here](https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/1hjukl2/run) and fill out the survey. You are free to submit as many trivia questions as you like, although we may discard submissions from participants who submit a large number of questions that in our view have little chance of being high-quality.

The survey above will ask you to pre-specify how many questions you are submitting. For each question, you will be required to submit four multiple choice answers. Please bear in mind that high-quality questions must have well-designed incorrect answers, as the incorrect answers presented have a large effect on accuracy rates.

If you have already participated and would like to participate again, you may do so. But repeat participants will need to re-complete the demographic questions at the end so that we can match it to your previous submission.
