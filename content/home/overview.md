We are accepting submissions on two types of trivia question.

## Republican "False Beliefs"

These are politically-relevant questions that a person who identifies as a **Democrat** is much more likely to get correct than a person who identifies as a **Republican**. Crucially, both Republican and Democrat respondents should have a strong hunch that their answer is right, while only one (easily verifiable) response will be. Because these questions are politically controversial, they should be selected and phrased in a way that the correct answer can be verified (citing specific statistics, for example).

Here are some pre-tested examples where the average Democrat is likely to guess closer to the correct answer than the average Republican:

**What percentage of climate change scientists believe that climate change is primarily caused by human activity?**

- **97%**
- 88%
- 62%
- 26%

To be clear: we are not looking for questions about which people in different political parties already have conflicting explicit beliefs. For example, a bad question would be, “Where was Barack Obama born?” While this question is likely to generate large differences in the pattern of answers between Republicans and Democrats, and both sides will have strong hunches that their answer is correct, we are interested only in questions where Republicans and Democrats don’t already have a precise, pre-existing belief about the answer to a question. It should be possible for both sides to accept the right answer when it is revealed. This requires questions for which partisans have intuitive “hunches” guided by their politics, but not explicit, specific beliefs.

Answers to all questions must be backed by credible sources. Examples of credible sources include scholarly journal articles or institutional research reports. Examples of non-credible sources include blog posts or opinion articles. We reserve the right to determine which sources count as credible.
